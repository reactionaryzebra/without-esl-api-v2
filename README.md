## Without ESL

This is a copy of the repo found [here](https://github.com/reactionaryzebra/without-esl-api).

This duplicate was made in preparation for deployment should anything have gone wrong so I would have a copy of the original.

This is the api for an app used to determine Premier League results should any of the ESL 6 have left the league.

Please refer to the [client repo](https://github.com/reactionaryzebra/without-esl-frontend) for more info.
